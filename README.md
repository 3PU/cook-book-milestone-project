## General Information

### Code Institute Coding Bootcamp - Data Centric Development Milestone Project

Switching to a vegetarian diet can be a challenge for many as most recipes for a long time across the world have included meat
and finding a large collection/resource of different vegetarian recipes can be tricky.

The idea behind VeggiPedia is to create a huge database of vegeterian recipes with the help of its users similar to how wikipedia,
but for recipes.
